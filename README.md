# VegetableClassifierCNN
implementation of a convolutional neural network (CNN) for classification of 15 different types of vegetables, using the dataset present at https://www.kaggle.com/misrakahmed/vegetable-image-dataset

Best accuracy achieved so far was 85% taking around 8 minutes of training, with a 3 convolutional layers and 4 linear layers configuration and augmenting the dataset by flipping every image.
More experimentation needs to be done by tweaking hyperparameters and possibly image size, as well as adding more augmentation transformations.
